Vectorial representations allow space-efficient, informationally rich storage of words that adequately captures their semantic content and enables numerical computation on them. Word vectors are the standard input representation for machine learning architectures for language processing. Even though new methods for constructing such representations emerge frequently, the original set of published papers remain a de facto point of reference as well as a good starting point. For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a small-scale variant of one such paper, namely [Global Word Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) (\"the GloVe paper\").\n","\n","Notes on the paper will appear throughout the notebook to guide you along the code. It is, however, important to read and understand the paper, its terminology and the theory behind it before attempting to go through with the assignment. Some of the tasks will also require addressing the paper directly.\n","\n","---\n","\n","There are 2 types of tasks in this assignment:\n","- coding tasks --- asking you to write code following specifications provided; Most of the tasks come with test cases for sanity-check. Still, if something is not clear, <ins>do ask questions to lab teachers</ins>. When working with tensors, you have to use tensor-related operations instead of, e.g., inefficiently looping through tensor rows and columns.\n","- interpretation questions --- asking you to interpret the data or the results of the model\n","\n","Each comes with its predefined points (totaling to 50pt). Some coding tasks have 0 points but solving them will be useful for you.\n","\n","---\n","\n","You are greatly encouraged to add comments to your code describing what particular lines of code do (in general, a great habit to have in your coding life).\n","Additionally please follow these rules when submitting the notebook:\n","\n","* Put all code in the cell with the `# YOUR CODE HERE` comment.\n","* For theoretical questions, put your solution in the `YOUR ANSWER HERE` cell and keep the header(!).\n","* Don't change or delete any initially provided cells, either text or code, unless explicitly instructed to do so.\n","* Don't delete the comment lines `# TEST...` or edit their code cells. The test cells are for sanity checking. Passing them doesn't necessarily means that your code is fine.\n","* Don't change the names of provided functions and variables or arguments of the functions.\n","* Don't clear the output of your code cells.\n","* Don't output unnecessary info (e.g., printing variables for debugging purposes). This clutters the notebook and slows down the grading. You can have print() in the code, but comment them out before submitting the notebook.\n","* Delete those cells that you inserted for your own debuging/testing purposes.\n","* Don't forget to fill in the contribution information.\n","* Test your code and **make sure we can run your notebook** in the colab environment.\n","* A single notebook file (without archiving) per group should be submitted via BB.\n","\n","<font color=\"red\">You following these rules helps us to grade the submissions relatively efficiently.

'quidditch', which are all related to the house's activities, especially its participation in Quidditch matches.\n","\n","**\"wand\":** The most similar words are more abstract (e.g., 'spoke',

bird.\n","\n","**\"triwizard\":** The words 'tournament', 'champions', 'cedric', and 'cup' all relate to the Triwizard Tournament in the fourth book.\n","\n","**\"screaming\":** Words like 'scream', 'voices', and 'screams' are directly related to the act of screaming, showing strong contextual relevance.\n","\n","**\"letter\":** Similar words include 'letters', 'hedwig' (Harry's owl who delivers
